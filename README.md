# deck-of-cards
This is a small implementation of a standard deck of playing cards.

## Usage
A new `DeckOfCards` created with the no argument constructor will provide a standard 52 card deck. The deck has the
ability to deal cards and shuffle the deck. Shuffling will result in all cards being ready to deal again in a new random
order. 

`DeckOfCards` can also be created using a custom list of `Card` objects. The deck allows duplicate cards if needed for
custom usage.
